                <p class="modal-content-item">
                    "DSLR U Sure?" is built to help new photographers learn how to get the most out of their DSLR camera! 
                    I decided to pick up photography as a hobby after taking a physics course in college that covered lenses and light (Yes... I'm a huge nerd!). 
                    As I first started using my camera, I realized I wasn't able to create the effects I was hoping for. I'll give you one guess as to why... I WASN'T USING MANUAL MODE! 
                    Although the technology in modern cameras' full-auto mode is great for "point and shoot", it removes almost all of the creative control you have over the moments you capture with your camera. 
                    But as I started using Manual mode, I quickly realized the learning curve is STEEP! 
                    After I couldn't find a resource that was particularly helpful, I decided to create my own.
                </p>
                <p class="modal-content-item">
                    I designed "DSLR U Sure?" to help visualize what the controls actually do to your image; as you adjust the controls, it shows you the effect...IN REAL-TIME! 
                    Below I've outlined what to look for when adjusting each control:
                </p>
                <ul class="modal-content-item">
                    <li class="modal-content-item">
                        <span class="modal-content-item-subtitle">Aperture: </span> adjusting aperture or 'f-stop' will change the depth of field of the image, causing objects too far from your focus point to become blurry. 
                        To do this, the aperture (hole that funnels light onto the sensor) changes in size. 
                        A bigger aperture (closer to F1.4) means fewer background objects will be in focus. A smaller aperture (closer to F22.0) means more of the image will be in focus. 
                        When adjusting this setting look to see how the cloud (closer) and mountain (farther) change.
                    </li>
                    <li class="modal-content-item">
                        <span class="modal-content-item-subtitle">Shutter: </span> adjusting shutter speed will change the how much time the shutter is open, exposing the sensor to light. 
                        This comes into play when photographing moving objects. If the shutter speed is too slow, the moving object will appear blurry. 
                        This can be a creative choice to add some blur to the image to create the sense of motion for the photograph. 
                        Look to see how the moving propeller blurs as the shutter speed gets closer to 1/25. 
                        Look to see how the shutter/sensor animation changes, as well.
