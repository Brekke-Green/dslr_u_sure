The project will be a learning tool/game for understanding how camera controls (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO) work in manual mode.

## intro/context
Many people have expensive DSLR cameras and never use all of the features because they aren't able to use manual mode. It's much like having a sports car that never leaves your driveway!

## MVPs
Adjust the camera control sliders to better understand how they effect the image captured by the camera. Also may have game functionality where the user will try to match a specified image by adjusting the sliders accordingly and will receive points for how close/how many tries it took for them to recreate the image. Aperture control slider - adjusting the aperture slider will simulate a change to the aperture of the camera and the setting will reflect in the range of focus in the captured image as well. Shutter control slider - adjusting the shutter slider will simulate a change to the shutter speed of the camera and the setting will reflect in the amount of movement blur in the captured image as well. ISO control slider - adjusting the sensor slider will simulate a change to the ISO of the camera and the setting will reflect in the exposure/image noise in the captured image as well. 

## tech/architecture
The images will be created using Canvas and adjusting the sliders will show how the camera adjusts.
