The project will be a learning tool/game for understanding how camera controls (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO) work in manual mode.

## Intro/Context
Many people have expensive DSLR cameras and never use all of the features because they aren't able to use manual mode. It's much like having a sports car that never leaves your driveway! Adjust the camera control sliders to better understand how they effect the image captured by the camera.

## MVPs 
MVP 1 - Aperture control slider - adjusting the aperture slider will simulate a change to the aperture of the camera and the setting will reflect in the range of focus in the captured image as well. 
MVP 2 - Shutter control slider - adjusting the shutter slider will simulate a change to the shutter speed of the camera and the setting will reflect in the amount of movement blur in the captured image as well. 
MVP 3 - ISO control slider - adjusting the sensor slider will simulate a change to the ISO of the camera and the setting will reflect in the exposure/image noise in the captured image as well. 

BONUS: Also may have game functionality where the user will try to match a specified image by adjusting the sliders accordingly and will receive points for how close/how many tries it took for them to recreate the image.

## Tech/Architecture
The images will be created using Canvas and adjusting the sliders will show how the camera adjusts.

## Timeline
1. Outline the function of aperture, shutter speed, and sensor adjustments. (4/5)
2. Create the Canvas images with animations for Aperture. (4/6)
3. Connect animations to the Aperture slider. (4/7)
4. Create the Canvas images with animations for Shutter.(4/8)
5. Connect animations to the Shutter speed slider. (4/9)
6. Create the Canvas images with animations for Sensor. (4/10)
7. Connect animations to the ISO slider. (4/11)
